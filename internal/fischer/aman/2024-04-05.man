In particular, dividing a(n) by its largest prime factor will leave a practical number, since the criterion applies inductively on the product of smaller primes, so if the largest prime factor of a(n) is greater than p or the exponent of p is greater than 1, then a(n) can be reduced to a smaller multiple of p and is thus not minimal
