# %N A276290 Products of odd primes p and q such that either p or q is in the trajectory of (p*q)+1 under the Collatz 3x+1 map (A014682).
# %C A276290 Conjecture: If n is the product of two odd primes p and q and p is equal to 3, then neither p nor q is in the trajectory of (p*q)+1 under the Collatz 3x+1 map (A014682). - _Marina Ibrishimova_, Aug 29 2016
# %C A332018 This is the '5x+1' map with the successive dividing steps removed. The 'Px+1' map with those steps removed: If x is divisible by any prime < P, then divide out those primes; otherwise multiply x by P, add 1, and then divide out the primes < P.
